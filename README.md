 * This project is made to perform various actions on an array.
 *
 * Sample array of type unsigned char is defined in the main function. 
 * Header file stats.h is included. Functions from the stats.h user- 
 * defined library are called in the stats.c file and executed the 
 * program is run. 
 *
 * Various functions that perform instructions to print an array, find the
 * maximum and minimum of an array, etc. are defined in the stats.h file.
 * The functions defined include:-
 *
 * 1. print_array()
 * @brief print_array prints the elements of the array
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to print the passed array uing a for loop
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return no value
 *
 * 2. find_median()
 * @brief find_median computes the median of a passed array
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to calculate the median of the elements of the array
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return the median of the array
 *
 * 3. find_mean()
 * @brief find_mean calculates the mean of the list of eements in the array
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to calculate the median of the elements of the array
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return the median of the array
 *
 * 4. find_maximum()
 * @brief find_maximum finds the largest element of the array
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to search through the array for the largest value
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return the largest element of the array
 *
 * 5. find_minimum()
 * * @brief find_minimum finds the largest element of the array
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to search through the array for the smallest value
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return the smallest element of the array
 *
 * 6. sort_array()
 * @brief sort_array sorts the elements of the array in descending order
 *
 * This functions takes an array and its length as an input and 
 * proceeds to sort the array in descending order
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @return no value
 *
 * 7. print_statistics()
* @brief print_statistic prints the statistics of the given array 
 * (which includes minimum, maximum, mean and median of the array)
 *
 * This functions takes an array, its length, its maximum value,
 *  minimum value, mean and median as an input and proceeds print the data
 *
 * @param array The array to be printed
 * @param n The length of the array
 * @param max The largest value of the array
 * @param min The smallest value of the array
 * @param mean The mean of the elements of the array
 * @param median The median of the elements of the array
 * @return no value
 *
 *
 * The main() in the stats.c file calls the functions defined above.
